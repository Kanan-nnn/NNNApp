## About the app
This is it. The app borne specifically for the listeners of the no new notifications podcast. A revolutionary app, allowing lucky downloaders swift immutable access to:
1. The podcast —in (correct) order!
2. Secure notes, so secure, that you can't see them for long.
3. A dedicated power button to switch on and switch off the app.
4. No account creation required. We don't care who you are, where you're from, what you do, as long as you like the app.

The official application of the No New Notifications Network. Empowers you to listen to your favourite podcasts (within the network). The app also includes deluxe, bespoke and maybe even artisanal features, such as a power on page (to give you the space and time to activate the app at your own leisure), an ephemeral notes page, thoughts for the day, and a healthy social media section containing only grey squares for you to double tap…and heal.

We understand that you have many options to fulfil your podcast needs, and so we ask you —aren’t you tired of having seamless experiences? Here in the NNN App we take you back to a time with seams and creases and frayed edges. New features are added as requested, and as the network grows!

## LORE AHEAD 

### Forged by the Mystic Abilites of Mylar, the NNNN app stands as a grudge against the multinational multibillion dollar Swedish music and podcast streaming company which thy shall not be named for legal reasons. 

###### (Spotify)

### Legend has it, Gorboroth the podcast eagle once overheard the plans of the nasty shapeshifting demon Tim with "the company" to once and for all remove the NNN Podcast from the existance of this universe and to banish Kanan & Manek to the mirror dimension. Spotify has understunderstood its mistake and is trying to make ammends, but will Kanan & Manek change their mind?, will Tim be successful in his plan?
